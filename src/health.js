@description
gives the player a "health bar" and damage them with dialog.
if the player's health becomes 0 or less, the endDialog will be triggered.

Usage:
  (changeHealth "1"): add one to the player's health, display "damage" text and current health.
	(changeHealth "-1"): subtract one from the player's health, display "healed" text and current health.
	(changeHealth "0"): display players health.

NOTE: adjust hackOptions below as needed.

HOW TO USE:
1. Copy-paste into a script tag after the bitsy source

  } else if (health > hackOptions.maxHealth) {

	}


	bitsy.scriptInterpreter.SetVariable('health', health);

	} else if (amount > 0) {
		printDialog(environment, `${hackOptions.healedText} ${amount}! ${wasDamaged ? "" : hackOptions.healFailText}`, onReturn);
