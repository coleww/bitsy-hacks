Prevents the player from moving up.
Player can only move left or right if their last move was down.

NOTE that this script assumes the player can only move 1 space at a time.

HOW TO USE:
1. Copy-paste into a script tag after the bitsy source
2. Edit `preventUpwardMovement` and `restrictHorizontalMovement` below as needed

	// 	pressing up will do nothing

	// If `restrictHorizontalMovement` is true:
	// 	pressing left/right will only move the player's sprite left/right
	//  if their last movement was downward
	restrictHorizontalMovement: true
